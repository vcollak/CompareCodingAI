## Background

I performed a simple test to determine how AI coding assistants stack against each other. Specifically, I let various AI models and tools create a Python FastAPI to manage users. I then asked AI to evaluate the quality of the code.

*Disclaimers:*
- Your mileage will almost certainly vary. First, the models and tools evolve at an incredible speed. What’s true today will almost surely not be true tomorrow.
- Secondly, I tested against Python code, which is probably one of the most understood languages by AI models. The results with your language may vary.
- Lastly, this is a rather simplistic test.

## Storage Implementation

| Implementation | Storage Method | Data Structure |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Windsurf | In-memory | Dictionary with UUID keys |
| Gemini | In-memory | Dictionary with UUID keys |
| Cursor | In-memory | Dictionary with UUID keys |
| Copilot Sonnet | In-memory | List of dictionaries |
| Copilot GPT | In-memory | List of objects |

## Detailed Analysis

### Windsurf (with Sonnet 3.7)
The most complete implementation with timestamp tracking, email uniqueness validation, and comprehensive field validation. Includes notes about password hashing (though not implemented). Has the most robust data validation and error handling of all implementations.

### Gemini 2.1 Pro
Clean, well-structured API with good documentation and clear model separation. Uses the model_dump method for efficient updates with exclude_unset. Lacks some validations like email uniqueness and timestamp tracking.

### Cursor (with Sonnet 3.7)
Well-documented with proper API organization using tags. Provides example schemas for better API documentation. Has robust field validation but lacks timestamp tracking and email uniqueness verification.

### Github Copilot (with Sonnet 3.7)
Solid implementation using UUIDs for IDs and providing good example schemas. Less detailed field validation than Windsurf and Cursor implementations. Uses a list storage approach rather than a dictionary.

### Github Copilot (with GPT 4.0)
The most minimal implementation using integer IDs instead of UUIDs. Missing the delete endpoint and has limited validation. No partial update support and lacks detailed documentation. The least production-ready of all implementations.

## Conclusion

The **Windsurf** implementation is the most production-ready with the most comprehensive validation, error handling, and data management features. It includes timestamp tracking, email uniqueness checks, and notes about security considerations.

For a truly production-ready API, any of these implementations would need additional features:
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Persistent database storage
- Logging
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Password hashing implementation
- Input sanitization
